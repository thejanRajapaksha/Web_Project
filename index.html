      <div class="news1 news"><br><h3>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may have spotted weird stars powered by dark matter instead of nuclear fusion.</h3><br> If these stars are really out there, it could solve three major cosmic mysteries in one fell swoop.Regular stars form when a cloud of dust and gas becomes so massive that it collapses in on itself, and the pressure and temperature in the centre are high enough to begin the process of nuclear fusion, wherein atoms slam together and merge into heavier elements. So-called dark stars wouldn’t have any fusion at all – in the early universe, they could form from similar clouds rich in dark matter. For several postulated types of dark matter, when two particles collide they should annihilate in a blast of energy, which would be intense enough to power a supermassive star. <br>

      <div class="news2 news"><br><h3>Stars found hidden in huge cloud wrapped around the Milky Way</h3><br>A group of stars hidden in a vast stream of dust and gas that wraps around the Milky Way, which astronomers have been hunting for decades, has been found. These stars could give us clues about the history of two of the Milky Way’s closest dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which feed this ribbon of material. <br><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2382128-stars-found-hidden-in-huge-cloud-wrapped-around-the-milky-way/">Read More</a> </div>
      <div class="news3 news"><br><h3>Time appears to run five times slower in the early universe</h3><br>Time seems to have ticked more slowly when the universe was young, according to observations of ancient astronomical objects that appear to evolve at a fifth of the rate we see today.

        The idea that time appears to be slower in the past sounds odd, but it is a direct consequence of the expansion of the universe since the big bang. This expansion means that light from ancient cosmic events must travel increasingly longer distances to reach Earth, and therefore takes more time to arrive. As a result, cosmic events that are extremely distant or far back in time appear to unfold more slowly compared to the same event happening nearby, right now. That isn’t to say the early universe was in slow motion, however – anyone present billions of years ago would have seen time evolving normally. <br><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2380881-time-appears-to-run-five-times-slower-in-the-early-universe/">Read More</a></div>

This gamma ray burst (GRB) seems to have come from two stars smashing together near the centre of an old galaxy, a vastly different origin from other events like it.

        There are two types of GRBs: short ones, which last 2 seconds or less, and long ones. Long GRBs are generally thought to occur when a massive star explodes in a supernova, whereas most short GRBs seem to come from binary neutron stars – incredibly dense stellar corpses – smashing together. <br><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2379582-odd-gamma-ray-burst-may-be-from-a-smash-up-between-two-dead-stars/">Read More</a></div>
