    <div class="news2 news"><br><h3>Mars landing</h3><br>A Mars landing is a landing of a spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Of multiple attempted Mars landings by robotic,
         uncrewed spacecraft, ten have had successful soft landings. There have also been studies for a possible human mission to Mars, including a landing, but none have been attempted.
          Soviet Union’s Mars 3, which landed in 1971, was the first successful Mars landing. As of 2022, 
        the Soviet Union, United States, and China have conducted Mars landings successfully. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_landing#:~:text=The%20Mars%203%20lander%20became,transmission%20ceased%20for%20unknown%20reasons.">Read More</a> </div>

    <div class="news4 news"><br><h3>Exploration of Jupiter</h3><br>The exploration of Jupiter has been conducted via close observations by automated spacecraft.
         It began with the arrival of Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, as of 2023, has continued with eight further spacecraft missions in the vicinity of Jupiter.
          All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two were flybys taking detailed observations without landing or entering orbit. 
          These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. 
          Sending a craft to Jupiter is difficult,
         mostly due to large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Jupiter">Read More</a></div>
    
    
    
    <div class="news2 news"><br><h3>Moon landing</h3><br> A Moon landing or lunar landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both crewed and robotic missions. The first human-made object to touch the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2, on 13 September 1959.

        The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. There were six crewed U.S. landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings, with no soft landings happening between 22 August 1976 and 14 December 2013.
        
        The United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until 3 January 2019,
         when the Chinese Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing">Read More</a> </div>
